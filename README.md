basic apps for my needs with fancy status rpg-like

I made it for my smartphone by downloading ish (shell app for ios) and cloning my repository there. This way I can use everything I need anywhere and on any of my devices. and because of this, the window changes to 41x19 at startup.

now it's online, so you can use it on your own. but you have to adjust everything for yourself, there is an uncorrected problem with time zones in ish, so look at the code and correct your time zone code (e.g. my TZ=UTC-4), your currency in finance and the user's fields in stats. Initially, I tried to make the code readable, so it won't be a problem to find it.

git is also integrated, without leaving the application, you can push and pull to your github, for example.
